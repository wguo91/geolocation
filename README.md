# Avenue Code UI Challenge - Part I #

### Story Phrase ###
* As a curious web surfer, I want to be able to locate both me and any website on a map.
* I sometimes use a desktop, sometimes a tablet and sometimes a cell phone, so I need a responsive web page.

### Business Narrative / Scenario ###
* GeoLocation is a working web application which aims to retrieve details about the user's location. 
* You need to augment GeoLocation with a new form that will allow the user to find out the physical location of websites, by displaying its hosting position on a map. 
* This new form will consist in a text field for the user to input the website domain, and also a "Locate" button.
* You should store the visited website domain and it should be accessed in separate route /locations 
* There will be one more route /location:id which shows the details of the location along with the map.
* Single page application is required.
* You have to keep the current features working.

### Functional / Acceptance Criteria ###
* The new form input field should only accept website domains starting with "www."  or with the host name, e.g., "www.nytimes.com", "nytimes.com" or "g1.com.br" or "www.g1.com.br".
* When the user hits the Locate button, an asynchronous call should be made to http://ip-api.com/json/:host, where :host corresponds to the user input.
* If this async call is successful, a second panel must be rendered, below the form, displaying a map showing the website's physical location from the latitude and longitude coordinates of the JSON response and also location should be stored locally .
* When the user hits the existing My location button, his position must also be displayed on the map, **alone or besides a website location** if the user used that feature before.
* When the user hits the Reset location button, the user location must be cleared off from the map (but the website's location should still be displayed if any) and the history of locations should be cleared.
* When the user hits the browser's back or forward buttons, it should navigate between the pages/routes. Backbone Router can be used for that.
*  There should be a separate Page/route to show the list of Locations(already searched). Each location of the list should be a link on clicking the link should render new route to show all the details of the location.
* You need to add consistent user input and output validations for every possible scenario.


### Non-Functional / Acceptance Criteria ###
* You must employ Backbone.js framework.
* You must leverage reusability with the existing code. You might have to refactor some of it to backbone. Make sure to keep the existing functionality up and also to fix any bugs you might run into.
* It is expected that you use a template engine, such as Handlebars or Underscore.
* It is expected that you cover at least 80%+ of your code with JS testing. You can pick a framework of your preference like Jasmine, Chai, Mocha, QUnit.
* We also recommend that you use a presentation framework such as Twitter Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation.

### Technical Details ###
You should receive a JSON response from http://ip-api.com/json/:host similar to:

```
{  
   "as":"AS20044 S/A ESTADO DE MINAS",
   "city":"Belo Horizonte",
   "country":"Brazil",
   "countryCode":"BR",
   "isp":"S/a Estado De Minas",
   "lat":-19.9191,
   "lon":-43.9386,
   "org":"S/a Estado De Minas",
   "query":"200.188.178.56",
   "region":"MG",
   "regionName":"Minas Gerais",
   "status":"success",
   "timezone":"America/Sao_Paulo",
   "zip":""
}
```

Here are a few suggestions of tools to develop your responsive app:

* Twitter Bootstrap - https://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
* Zurb Foundation - http://foundation.zurb.com/
* RequireJS - http://requirejs.org/
* Underscore - http://underscorejs.org/
* Handlebars - http://handlebarsjs.com/
* Jasmine - http://jasmine.github.io/
* Chai - http://chaijs.com/
* Mocha - http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/
* QUnit - http://qunitjs.com/
* SASS - http://sass-lang.com/
* LESS - http://lesscss.org/

### Delivery Instructions ###

1. You must provide his BitBucket username. A free BitBucket account can be created at http://bitbucket.org
1. The recruiter will give you read permission to a repository named **ui-challenge**, at https://bitbucket.org/ac-recruitment/ui-challenge
1. You must fork this repository into a private repository on your own account and push your code in there.
1. Once finished, you must give the user **ac-recruitment** read permission on your repository so that you can be evaluated. Then, please contact back your recruiter and he will get an engineer to evaluate your test.
1. After you are evaluated, the recruiter will remove your read permission from the original repository.
1. Its very important that these steps are followed accordingly, as your git and overall version control skill will also be evaluated.

### Format ###

* This assessment must be delivered within 2 days.
* You must provide a README.txt (plain text) or a README.md (Markdown) file at the root of your repository, explaining:
    * How to compile and run the application.
    * How to run the suite of automated tests (unit tests, BDD tests, etc...).
    * Which JS libraries you've decided to use for this challenge.
    * Mention anything that was asked but not delivered and why, and any additional comments.
* Unclear or incomplete README instructions may subtract from your overall evaluation.
* Any questions, please send an email to **recruitment.engineering@avenuecode.com**

### Evaluation Criteria ###

1. Functional and non-functional acceptance criteria delivery.
1. Code quality: structure, modularization, reuse.
1. Code legibility and elegancy.
1. Frameworks usage.
1. Test coverage.

We have both functional and non-functional acceptance criterias, so we suggest that you pay attention to both. Furthermore, the quality of the application (number of bugs found), may also add or subtract points from the candidate.
